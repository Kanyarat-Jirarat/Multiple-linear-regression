3.3 Explain why choose the chart with your data

Given the current environmental concerns, particularly regarding PM2.5 pollution, I'm interested in

1. The top 20 countries with high levels of PM2.5 pollution.
2. Understanding the magnitude of increase or decrease in PM2.5 levels for each year.

Upon analyzing the data, it appears that the countries with the highest PM2.5 pollution levels are Nepal, India, and Qatar, in descending order. Additionally, I'm interested in whether there has been increase in PM2.5 levels for each year, indicated by the thickness of the bars on the graph. Overall, it's evident that in 2015, the amount of PM2.5 pollution was higher than in any other year.
